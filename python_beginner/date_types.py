# 8 main data type , which seperate to 2 types. 
# 1) Changeble 
# 2) Unchangeble

# Data types;
# 1) int

#     a float 
#     b) compilex 

# 2) str - string data type 
# 3) bool - locals data type ( he can be "try or false")
# 4) list - he can save different data types ([])
# 5) tuple - same list but different in that it can ba changed ()
# 6) set - can save unical things({})
# 7) dict - dictionary ({}). 
# 8) NoneType - for showing existing data types (None)

# In all of this data type only 3 of them can be changed (mutable)
# list
# dict
# set
# print("Hello, world!")

# IF variable named with big word it mean that it is constant!  (MY_CONST)

# Name your variable like you giving name to your son
